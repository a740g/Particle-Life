This is a [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe) version of [Particle Life Simulation](https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life). It is a simple program to simulate primitive artificial life using simple rules of attraction or repulsion among atom-like particles, producing complex self-organzing life-like patterns.

This also includes an early version of an immediate mode GUI library based on ideas from [Terry Ritchie](https://www.qb64tutorial.com/)'s [Graphic Line Input Library](https://qb64phoenix.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=84) and [Button Library](https://qb64phoenix.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=82). Thank you Terry!
